# HBCurvesControl
An image curves control UI to be used alongside GPUImage curves filter.

HBCurvesControl is a UI element designed to loosely imitate the curves adjustment found in editing software like Photoshop. This element is meant to be used with the  GPUImage Framewrk, and specifically the GPUImage curves filter.

The repo is under development (which should be obvious) and nowhere near done.
